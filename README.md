This project is a basic React application developed using React Flow. It showcases the functionality of dragging and dropping nodes, as well as connecting them. Additionally, it allows for saving and restoring the state of the nodes and their connections.

## Features

1) Drag and drop nodes.
2) Connect nodes by clicking and dragging from one node's edge to another.
3) Clicking on a node selects it, and its label can be modified from the sidebar.
4) Clicking anywhere on the pane deselects the selected node.
5) Save and restore functionality, which saves the current state of the nodes and their connections, and can restore the state later.
